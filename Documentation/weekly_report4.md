# Weekly report 3
## What did I achieve this week?

I was a little busy during the week, so the project did not proceed as I intended. However, I managed to start coding the trie. It is far from done, but the first version works with the test inputs. I also started writing implementation and testing documents. I will be writing more detailed versions of them within coming weeks.

## Progress of the program

As I said, I started working with the trie data structure. Now it is possible to add and find substrings. I still have to figure out, how to implement finding and returning a bunch of notes from it. I also added a couple decision for the user to make. It makes testing the program easier, when it is possible to decide, whether you want the pdf or musicxml version of the notes or open the MuseScore application. This feature is mainly for demonstration purposes, because the MuseScore can play the melody from notes.

## What did I learn this week?

I learned about the tries. Firstly I thought that I would do my own TreeMap kind of solution, but noticed that the trie is way more easier for this project. And I actually first thought that they are the same thing. Turns out they are not.

## Difficulties

I was not sure what kind of other tests the program would need, other than unit tests, so I did not make any. 

## What next?

I will try to finish the trie dataset, so that the program can use it. Deploying it requires some changes in the program itself. I should also try to solve the problem with the duration of the notes and generating them correctly.

### Used hours

I used about 10 hours working on the project
