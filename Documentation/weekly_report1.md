# Weekly report 1
## What did I achieve this week?

I did some background reading and decided to do a composer program. I created a GitHub repository and Gradle template for the project. I also wrote the initial design document.

## Progress of the program

I created the template of the program, but didn't start coding yet.

## What did I learn this week?

I'm not sure.

## Difficulties

I am little concerned whether I have chosen too hard project for me, but I decided to take the challenge. I am not sure which data structures or algorithms I am going to need let alone their time and space complexities. I did not find an example of algorithm used to create melodies, but I am sure I will find it if I search hard enough. I am also a little bit unsure whether the algorithm should choose the most likely note or for example one out of three most likely note next.

## What next?

Next I am going to start figure out problems listed above, find the training data and start programming. It should be wise to start with handling the data and computing the probability.

### Used hours

I used about 4 hours working on the project
