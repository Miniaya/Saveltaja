# Weekly report 3
## What did I achieve this week?

I added the duration of the notes to the songs and also added plenty of new notes to the file. I also created my own list class and replaced all ArrayList objects with my own list. 

## Progress of the program

The program works and produces a valid PDF file from LY file. Now the program also picks the next note by random. I would say that my program is developing well. Or at least it is working as intended.

## What did I learn this week?

I learned how to give command line commands from your program. 

## Difficulties

I had little problems while trying to give command line commands throught my program, but now it seems to be working. I am a bit nervous to start working with the trie, but I am sure if I just start finding information and coding, it will be just fine. I am also a bit worried about the size of my program. It feels like it is too small.

## What next?

Next I should start coding the trie and use that instead of treemap. I also thought that would be convenient if the program asked, if you want to automatically create the PDF and musicxml file and then open the MuseScore software, because not all have these downloaded in their computers.

### Used hours

I used about 17 hours working on the project
