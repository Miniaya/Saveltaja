# Weekly report 5
## What did I achieve this week?



## Progress of the program



## What did I learn this week?

I learned, or should I say reminded myself with the fact how important it is to make one component fully functional before adding it to the program. I started removing TreeMaps from the program a little too early and it was a little painful trying to solve problems with half-ready Trie data structure.

## Difficulties

I was not sure what kind of other tests the program would need, other than unit tests, so I did not make any. 

## What next?

I should also try to solve the problem with the duration of the notes and generating them correctly.

### Used hours

I used about  hours working on the project
