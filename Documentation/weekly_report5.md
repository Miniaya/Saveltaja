# Weekly report 5
## What did I achieve this week?

I finished the Trie data structure, and made a couple extra classes just to make things easier. Now when I finished the Trie, I do not have any Java libraries in my main program. FileDao has some, but they would be hard to implement by myself. I also found and wrote down more notes of the songs. Now I have over 50 songs in the note file. 

## Progress of the program

Implementing the Trie caused the need of some kind of way to store key-value -pairs, so I wrote class Dictionary. I also needed some way to generate random numbers, so I made random number generator, which generates pseudorandom numbers based on a simple mathematical expression. I would say that my program is in a good state, because the program works and the data structures are ready. It still needs a little finetuning, but I am pretty happy about what I have created.

## What did I learn this week?

I learned, or should I say reminded myself with the fact how important it is to make one component fully functional before adding it to the program. I started removing TreeMaps from the program a little too early and it was a little painful trying to solve problems with half-ready Trie data structure.

## Difficulties

I am still a little unsure about if my program needs other than unit tests. I think I can do some performance testing, but I do not know if it is something that is necessary in my project.

## What next?

I should do some finetuning and maybe think about how to decide about the duration of the song. It seems to be working now, but I have some ideas how to make some improvements.

### Used hours

I used about 17 hours working on the project
